            <p>The McRaven Tour Home is known as "The Most Haunted House in Mississippi," and visitors from all over agree that the house has earned this name.
            Knocking, footsteps, and whispered voices echo throughout the beautiful home, calling back to a time of great strife and disunity. We do not know 
            how many spirits haunt McRaven, but we know they are there, wandering as though no time has passed at all. Should you visit, you may catch a glimpse
            of one.</p>

            <p>Mary Elizabeth Howard is our most active spirit. She died at an early age in 1836 shortly after childbirth. She was the lady of the house as the 
            empire section was built by her husband, Sheriff Steven Howard. She is the most commonly spotted spirit, as she like to wander around her room 
            and the adjoining balcony.</p>

            <p>John Bobb built the grand Greek Parlor and Master Suite of McRaven. He and his wife Selena survived the Siege of Vicksburg at McRaven, which at 
            the time, was being used by the Confederacy as a field hospital. However, surviving the Siege did not prepare Mr. Bobb for the occupation, as he 
            was killed by Union troops only a year after the end of struggle for the city of Vicksburg. Come and hear his story as this prominent businessman 
            met his tragic end, and how he still strolls his balcony.</p>

            <p>Andrew Glass was a notorious highwayman who likely built McRaven as a hideout. He robbed people on the Natchez Trace and built two rooms at 
            McRaven to count his spoils. Oddly, the room is not all that different from the way he left it nearly 200 years ago. His spirit is active 
            at McRaven, and often seeks to add to his collection of treasures.</p>

              <p>These are only a few of the many spirits who wander McRaven Tour Home. Even the grounds surrounding the home remain active with the ghostly 
              figures of Confederate soldiers, wandering tirelessly over their own graves. </p>

        <h2>Investigate McRaven Tour Home</h2>
        <p>The McRaven Tour Home invites you to join one of our monthly investigations, or to book your own private investigation.</p>

          <p> - Our monthly investigation includes the Haunted tour beginning at 8:30pm. Following the tour, you will be instructed on the use of the ghost equipment, which 
          will be provided by the house (though you may also bring your own equipment if you would prefer). Investigations last typically up to 2:30am, though 
          you may leave at any time before if needed. Click <a href="tickets-rewrite.html">here</a> to purchase tickets for the next public investigation.</p>

          <p> - Private Investigations are run similar to our public investigations, however, the house in booked for your 
          party alone. You are welcome to bring equipment and set up in the rooms you would prefer, and you will also be provided with our own equipment if 
          necessary. A guide will be there to investigate with you, or to simply shut down the home after the investigation is complete.</p>

          <p> Should you wish to book a private investigation, contact us by call or email to set a date and receive the price.</p>
