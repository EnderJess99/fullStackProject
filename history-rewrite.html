            The Travel Channel, 48 Hours and countless local magazines and books about hauntings. Popular for being built in three different periods, 
            National Geographic called it the "Time Capsule of the South." Each addition to the house leaving the previous rooms untouched. Today McRaven is

                <p>The first portion of the house was built in 1797, the last year in which George Washington was president. Mississippi was not yet a part of the 
                United States. Highwayman Andrew Glass built a two-room brick structure with a bedroom above a kitchen, with a removable ladder to prevent an ambush 
                while he slept. The blueberry and buttermilk plaster still adorns the walls. Mr. Glass would rob people traveling the Natchez Trace and hide out in 
                McRaven. His surprising death became the start of McRaven's haunting.</p>

              <p>The second portion of McRaven was built in 1836 by Sheriff Stephen Howard. He enclosed a patio, creating a stairway and added a bedroom, 
              a dining room and two-story covered porch. Built in the Empire period, this portion of the house was simple but decorative touches. Sheriff Howard 
              lost his young wife Mary Elizabeth after childbirth, and her spirit is the most active ghost in the house. Mary Elizabeth often greets guests and 
              plays pranks. Some of her personal belongings are still in the house.</p>

              <p>The third part of the house was built in the Greek Revival style by John H. Bobb in 1849. He was a prominent brick manufacturer 
              and sawmill owner. Mr. Bobb built an elegant parlor, master bedroom, men's changing area, flying wing staircase and a Greek Revival facade which 
              he later replaced by the Italianate facade with "Vicksburg pillars."</p>
